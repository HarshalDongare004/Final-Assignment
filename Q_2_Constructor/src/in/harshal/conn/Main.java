/**
 * KEY POINTS ABOUT CONSTRUCTOR
 * 
 * A constructor is a special method which name is similar to class name.
 * 
 * Constructor is not called directly. It is called implicitly when object is created.
 * 
 * If Constructor is not there in a class JVM by default creates a default constructor with zero parameters.
 * 
 * Constructor cannot return a value
 * 
 * Constructor can be overloaded but different parameters.
 * 
 * Constructor cannot be made abstract.
 * 
 * The Constructor of parent class is called implicitly by the constructor of the child class.
